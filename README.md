# FYP_PhaseCorrelation
Final year project 

PhaseCorrelation.m is the main code used to apply phase correlation on one pair of images.

MeasureTime.m is used to meausre the running time of the code for differnet resize cofficient and analyze if the result holds correct after resizing image.

NormalCorrelation.m uses the matlab inbuilt function xcorr2(i.e. 2D cross correlation) to analyze one pair of images

Other files applies phase correlation on a whole set of images with differnet defocus length to see the relationship between defocus length and phase correlation result.
